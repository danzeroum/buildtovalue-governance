# PENALTY AGGREGATION RULES
# ============================================================================
# When multiple regulations apply, use these rules to calculate total exposure:

    - scenario: "EU AI Act + GDPR both apply"
      resolution: "Apply EU AI Act (higher penalty), cite GDPR as secondary"

      resolution: "Stack penalties (different legal bases: discrimination vs privacy)"

  mitigating_factors:
    - "Cooperation with regulatory authorities (-20% to -40%)"
    - "Self-reporting of violations (-30% to -50%)"
    - "Rapid remediation and controls implementation (-10% to -30%)"
    - "No prior violations in past 3 years (-15%)"
